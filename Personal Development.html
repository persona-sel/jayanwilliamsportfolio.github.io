        <h1>Twelve Pillars Summary</h1>
        <pre>    Michael is the focus of Chapter 4 and states that he is struggling at work and feels as though he is not living up to his potential because his career is not progressing as quickly as he would have liked.
            
    Charlie therefore recommends that he develops goals for himself in order to define his objectives. Charlie suggests that being without goals causes a person to become stagnant. 
            
    In order to verify that there is a goal and to make that goal a reality, according to Charlie, goals must be put in writing. Charlie argues that if you write down a goal, you are more likely to achieve it based on what Mr. David had said.

    He goes on to say that while success does not happen overnight, a direction can shift in an instant. Based on the new direction you want to take your life, career, money, work, etc. in the following ten years, that should be your objective. 
            
    Setting a goal is necessary, and achieving it requires working backwards from it. But starting is the wisest course of action. Charlie asserts in chapter 5 that time should be used carefully because days are costly. 
            
    When you spend time on achieving your goals, its conversion extends to opportunities, and those opportunities are usually implemented. Time should be focused on the important aspects of life rather than the urgent ones because no one else has any plans for your life other than yourself. 
            
    In Chapter 6, Michael shares how his relationship with his wife has improved. He also writes out 100 goals and separates them into long-term and short-term goals. The next step, according to Charlie, is to surround yourself with the best. 
            
    This is surrounding yourself with the most successful individuals who have a winning mindset and similar values, ambitions, and talents. People have tremendous influence over you and can have a big impact on your fate. 
            
    Chapter 7 also discusses the importance of knowledge and ongoing education. The chapter implies that being a lifelong learner is necessary for success. Formal education can be attributed to helping people make a living, but self-education is the key to financial success. 
           
    By teaching yourself, you can grow and improve over time and eventually start making money. Self-education opens your mind to continually search for new information. 
    
    After reading books, successful people should be observed, and then you should reflect on your own experiences, analyse the actions you took, and make any necessary corrections.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <pre>        The Twelve Pillars have been an eyeopener to me. I have had similar ideas and concepts explained to me from primary to tertiary. 
        
        Moving forward and setting goals has become an important conversion to me and many of my colleagues. 
        
        Although, I am in college it is a priority to think about my next steps and what objectives I want to accomplish by the end of my career. 
        
        The book outlines the setting goals since that is the most integral first step in accomplishing the ideas and thoughts that may seem out of reach. 
        
        Next is segmenting those goals into short term and long-term goals and set a reasonable timeframe to complete or achieve them. 
        
        I will now set goals to have them fermented in stone and see them every day to remind myself on the next step forward. The book also highlighted those goals should also be linked. 
        
        This will allow my short-term goals to be of benefit to my long-term goals. I believe this frame of mind will allow me to not feel like my goal is out of reach and that steps although small are being taken and progress is being made.
        
        Continuously learning and surrounding yourself with the best people are also another important component. Learning opens your mind to new ideas and the need to gain answers. 
        
        I really appreciated the portion that states the people around greatly influence you and can impact your future. It made me more conscious of the people I choose to associate with and it further cements that I am on the right path. 
        
        I will surely be adopting these steps to accomplish my future goals.
